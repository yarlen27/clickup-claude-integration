# ClickUp Integration for Claude Code

🚀 A comprehensive ClickUp integration toolkit that enables Claude Code to manage projects, create tasks, analyze workflows, and automate project management through natural language commands.

## 🎯 Project Status

### ✅ Completed (Proof of Concept)
- **Full ClickUp API Integration**: Complete CRUD operations for all ClickUp entities
- **Natural Language Member Assignment**: "assign to Juan" → automatic user ID resolution
- **Complete Hierarchy Management**: Teams → Spaces → Folders → Lists → Tasks
- **Smart Member Search**: Search by username, email, or ID with fuzzy matching
- **Rate Limiting & Error Handling**: Respects ClickUp API limits (100-10K req/min)

### 🏗️ Planned Architecture
```
Claude Code ←→ MCP Server ←→ .NET API ←→ ClickUp API
           JSON-RPC      HTTP REST    HTTP REST
```

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** enables Claude Code to automatically discover and use ClickUp tools through natural language commands.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: .NET 8.0 + Clean Architecture + DDD + CQRS
- **Integration**: MCP Server (Node.js + TypeScript) 
- **Deployment**: Docker containerized stack
- **Cache**: Redis for member/project data
- **Testing**: xUnit + FluentAssertions + NSubstitute

## 🎮 Planned User Experience

```bash
# Claude Code understands natural language
User: "Create a task for implementing user authentication, assign it to Juan with high priority, due in 2 weeks"

Claude Code: 
✅ Task created: "Implement user authentication"
   🆔 ID: ABC-123
   👤 Assigned: Juan (juan@27cobalto.com)  
   🔥 Priority: High
   📅 Due: 2025-07-27
   🔗 URL: https://app.clickup.com/t/ABC-123
```

## 🔧 Current Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/yarlen-cobalto/clickup-claude-integration
cd clickup-claude-integration
dotnet build

# Configure ClickUp API token
dotnet user-secrets set "ClickUp:ApiToken" "your_token_here" --project src/ClickUp.Console

# Test the current POC
dotnet run --project src/ClickUp.Console
```

## 📋 Validated Capabilities

### Team & Member Management
- **8 team members** with role mapping (owner, admin, member)
- **Natural language search**: "juan" → exact user resolution
- **Flexible identifiers**: username, email, or ID
- **Smart assignment**: Mixed identifier resolution

### Project Hierarchy  
- **Workspaces/Teams**: Multi-team support
- **Spaces**: Project organization with features
- **Folders**: Hierarchical structure
- **Lists**: Task containers with metadata
- **Tasks**: Full CRUD with rich metadata

### Task Management
- **Natural language creation**: Rich task descriptions
- **Due dates**: Flexible date parsing
- **Priority levels**: Low, normal, high, urgent
- **Multiple assignees**: Team collaboration
- **Tags & metadata**: Custom categorization

## 🎯 Planned MCP Tools

- `create_task` - Natural language task creation with smart assignment
- `find_member` - Resolve team members by name/email/role
- `analyze_delays` - Project delay analysis and bottleneck detection  
- `assign_optimal` - Workload-based smart assignment
- `create_project_structure` - Bootstrap projects with templates
- `workflow_automation` - Custom workflow triggers

## 🐳 Planned Containerized Deployment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  mcp-server:    # Node.js MCP Server (Port 3000)
  clickup-api:   # .NET API Backend (Port 5000)
  redis:         # Cache Layer (Port 6379)
```

```bash
# One command deployment
docker-compose up -d

# Claude Code automatically discovers tools
echo "ClickUp integration ready for Claude Code! 🚀"
```

## 🎭 Demo Results

**Member Resolution Test:**
```
Input:  ["juan", "yarlen@27cobalto.com", "81585056"]
Output: [81340798, 114172087, 81585056]
Result: ✅ Task assigned to 3 team members automatically
```

**Natural Language Assignment:**
```
User: "Assign to Juan" 
System: ✅ Resolved to juan (ID: 81340798)

User: "Find frontend team"
System: ✅ Found 3 members with frontend skills

User: "Create urgent task for API bug"  
System: ✅ Task created with high priority, assigned to backend team
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement MCP Server** (Node.js)
2. **Create .NET REST API** wrapper
3. **Containerize full stack**
4. **Claude Code integration testing**
5. **Advanced analytics tools**
